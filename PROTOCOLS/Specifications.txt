# Protocol Specifications

This file contains detailed specifications for the three protocols, including the necessary labware 
and step-by-step instructions for each one.

#Protocol 1: "Cell_lysis.py"
- Summary
This protocol involves transferring 100 µL of solution from the first column of the reservoir into well 
A2 of the first 96-well plate, followed by transferring another 100 µL from the first column of the 
reservoir into well A3, continuing this process until well A11 is reached. Afterward, each well from A2 
to A11 is mixed twice, and the pipette tip is washed in well A12 of the reservoir between each transfer, 
to be discarded. If the protocol is performed for multiple plates, the robot first follows the procedure 
outlined above for the first plate, then applies the same steps to the second plate, using 100 µL from 
column A2 of the reservoir.
Therefore, a washing solution for the tips (e.g., bleach) should be manually prepared in column A12 of 
the reservoir. Additionally, if more than one plate is being processed, 10 mL of lysis solution should 
be placed in the respective column of the reservoir (one column per plate, starting from A1 for the 
first plate).
- Labware needed 
Reservoir: nest_12_reservoir_15ml

##This protocol uses different coordinates for each piece of labware. To use the default coordinates, 
##simply delete the line "labware.set_offset()" for each item.

Protocol 2: "Drugs_combinations_on_PCR_plate.py"


Protocol 3: "Transferring_to_384-well_plate_and_substrate_addition.py"
