#Protocol Specifications
This file contains detailed specifications for the three protocols, including the necessary labware 
and step-by-step instructions for each one.
Protocols uses specific coordinates for each labware. If you want to use the default coordinates, remove 
the line "labware.set_offset()" for each item


#Protocol 1: "Cell_lysis.py"
- Summary
This protocol involves transferring 100 µL of solution from the first column of the reservoir into well 
A2 of the first 96-well plate, followed by transferring another 100 µL from the first column of the 
reservoir into well A3, continuing this process until well A11 is reached. Afterward, each well from A2 
to A11 is mixed twice, and the pipette tip is washed in well A12 of the reservoir between each transfer, 
to be discarded. If the protocol is performed for multiple plates, the robot first follows the procedure 
outlined above for the first plate, then applies the same steps to the second plate, using 100 µL from 
column A2 of the reservoir.
Therefore, a washing solution for the tips (e.g., bleach) should be manually prepared in column A12 of 
the reservoir. Additionally, if more than one plate is being processed, 10 mL of lysis solution should 
be placed in the respective column of the reservoir (one column per plate, starting from A1 for the 
first plate).

Protocol 2: "Drugs_combination_on_PCR_plate.py"
- Summary
This protocol requires manually placing the compounds into the first well of the first row (A2) and the 
first column (B1) of the PCR plate (at least 80 µL). Additionally, requires preparing an Eppendorf with 
DMSO in well A1 of the tuberack (1 mL). 
The protocol starts by adding DMSO into the first row and column, except for the wells where compounds 
were manually placed. The robot will transfer 50 µL from Eppendorf A1 in the tuberack to well A3 of the 
PCR plate, then from Eppendorf A1 to A4 in PCR plate, and so on. Afterward, it will fill the first column 
by aspirating again from Eppendorf A1 and transferring to C1, D1, and continuing until reaching G1. Then, 
serial dilutions of the compounds will be made in the first row (from A2 to A9) and the first column (from 
B1 to F1), transferring 50 µL each time. Finally, combinations will be made between the rows and columns; 
for this the robot will first distribute the content of column 1 along the rows (i.e., from B1 to B10, 
from B1 to B9, and so on), then it will distribute the content of the first row along each column (from 
A2 to G2, A2 to F2, etc).
