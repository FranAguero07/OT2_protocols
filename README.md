This repository contains scripts (.py) for protocols described in our paper, designed for use with the Opentrons OT-2 automated pipetting robot. These protocols cover:
- Preparation of drug dilutions and combinations
- Cell lysis procedure
- Solution transfer to 384-well plates and substrate addition
Additionally, a specification file (.txt) details required labware and procedural steps for each protocol.
