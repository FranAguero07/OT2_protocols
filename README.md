# Protocols for Opentrons OT-2
By The Trypanosomatics Laboratory, UNSAM

This repository contains scripts (.py) for protocols described in our paper, designed for use with the Opentrons OT-2 automated pipetting robot. These protocols cover:
- Preparation of drug dilutions and combinations.
- Cell lysis procedure.
- Solution transfer to 384-well plates and substrate addition.

Additionally, a specification file (.txt) details required labware and procedural steps for each protocol.

# How to use this protocols  
First of all, it is important to clarify that the following steps were carried out using **Ubuntu**, a terminal that is already included in **Linux**. If using **Windows**, the terminal can be downloaded as indicated in the first three steps of the official Opentrons site at the following link: (https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Write-and-simulate-protocols-on-Windows-10). It is recommended to use this setup to correctly follow these instructions and avoid any issues.  

### Step-by-Step Guide  
1. **Access the Protocols Folder**  
   Once inside the **GitHub repository**, navigate to the **"PROTOCOLS"** folder. Inside, there will be a file named **"Specifications.txt"** (previously mentioned) along with three additional files, which are the protocols. Open one of these three protocol files.  


2. **Copy the Raw File URL**  
   Once the desired file is open, click on the **"Raw"** button (Figure 1) and copy the URL of the page that opens, as shown in Figure 2.

   Example of a copied URL:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/file.py


3. **Download the File to the Local System**  
The next step is to download the selected file to the local system.  
- Open the **Linux terminal** in the folder where the protocol should be downloaded.  
  - One way to do this is by manually opening the folder, right-clicking inside it, and selecting **"Open in Terminal."**  
  - Another way, if the terminal is already open, is to navigate to the desired folder using the command:  
    ```sh
    cd folder_name
    ```
- Once in the correct folder, type the following command in the terminal, replacing the URL with the copied one from step 2:  
  ```sh
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/file.py
  ```
- After running this command, the file should be downloaded from **GitHub**. To verify the download, use:  
  ```sh
  ls -l
  ```

4. **Import the Protocol into the Opentrons Application**  
- Open the **Opentrons** application and go to the **"Protocols"** section. Click on the **"Upload"** option.  
- Select the downloaded file and click **"Open."**

- If other protocols have already been added, go to the **"Import"** section, where the **"Upload"** option will be available.

**Note:** It is essential to ensure that the downloaded file is in **`.py`** format. Otherwise, it will not be recognized by the application.
